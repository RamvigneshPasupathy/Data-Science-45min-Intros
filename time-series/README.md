# Time Series Modeling in Python 

This series was generally built using Python >=3.5, and libs:

```
matplotlib>=2.0
pandas>=0.19
numpy>=1.12
scipy>=0.19
statsmodels>=0.8
```

In Part 1 of the "Time Series Modeling in Python" series, we look at how ``pandas`` deals with time series data, and some of the handy functionality that the data structures have, built-in.

In Part 2, we implement a handful of simple time series models, apply them to some univariate time series data, and look at a couple of evaluation metrics for regression models. 

In Part 3, we look at a couple of variations of seasonal-trend decomposition including an implementation of STL decomposition.
